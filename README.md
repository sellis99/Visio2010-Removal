# Visio2010-Removal
I put together this little script to remove Visio Pro 2010 and install the free viewer
on machines in our workplace. We don't have a software distribution mechanism so this was the simplest way
I designed the script to be somewhat interactive and with minimal error-checking, so it really needs
to be run individually against each machine. In our environment of ~100 machines that wasn't too bad.
I imagine any more machines and you've likely got a software distribution solution already!
